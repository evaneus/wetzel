## Example

This JSON Schema:
```json
{
    "$schema" : "http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema",
    "title" : "example",
    "type" : "object",
    "description" : "Example description.",
    "properties" : {
        "byteOffset" : {
            "type" : "integer",
            "description" : "The offset relative to the start of the buffer in bytes.",
            "minimum" : 0,
            "default" : 0
        },
        "type" : {
            "type" : "string",
            "description" : "Specifies if the elements are scalars, vectors, or matrices.",
            "enum" : ["SCALAR", "VEC2", "VEC3", "VEC4", "MAT2", "MAT3", "MAT4"],
            "required" : true
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties" : false
}
```

is used to generate this Markdown documentation:

# Objects
* [`example`](#reference-example) (root object)


---------------------------------------
<a name="reference-example"></a>
## example

Example description.

**Properties**

|   |Type|Description|Required|
|---|----|-----------|--------|
|**byteOffset**|`integer`|The offset relative to the start of the buffer in bytes.|No, default: `0`|
|**type**|`string`|Specifies if the elements are scalars, vectors, or matrices.| :white_check_mark: Yes|

Additional properties are not allowed.

### example.byteOffset

The offset relative to the start of the buffer in bytes.

* **Type**: `integer`
* **Required**: No, default: `0`
* **Minimum**: ` >= 0`

### example.type :white_check_mark:

Specifies if the elements are scalars, vectors, or matrices.

* **Type**: `string`
* **Required**: Yes
* **Allowed values**:
   * `"SCALAR"`
   * `"VEC2"`
   * `"VEC3"`
   * `"VEC4"`
   * `"MAT2"`
   * `"MAT3"`
   * `"MAT4"`

## Getting Started

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't already have it, clone this repo, and then:
```
cd wetzel
npm install
```
Run `node bin/wetzel.js` and pass it the path to a file with a JSON Schema, and the generated Markdown is output to the console.

It is useful to pipe the Markdown output to the clipboard and then paste into a temporary GitHub issue for testing.

On Mac:
```
wetzel ../glTF/specification/2.0/schema/accessor.schema.json -l 2 | pbcopy
```

On Windows:
```
wetzel.js ../glTF/specification/2.0/schema/accessor.schema.json -l 2 | clip
```

Options:
* The `-l` option specifies the starting header level.
* The `-p` option lets you specify the relative path that should be used when referencing the schema, relative to where you store the documentation.
* The `-w` option will suppress any warnings about potential documentation problems that wetzel normally prints by default.
* The `-d` option lets you specify the root filename that will be used for writing intermediate wetzel artifacts that are useful when doing wetzel development.
* The `-a` option will attempt to aggressively auto-link referenced type names in descriptions between each other.  If it's too agressive, you can add `=cqo` so that it only attempts to auto-link type names that are within "code-quotes only" (cqo) (e.g.: ``typeName``)
* The `-i` option lets you specify an array of schema filenames that might be referenced by others, but shouldn't get their own documentation section.
* The `-r` option, if set to true, will display `(root object)` next to the root object in the table of contents.

## Common Usage

The most common way to use this tool is to generate the entire glTF documentation.
To do that, you simply need to pass-in the root schema file (glTF.schema.json):

```
wetzel ../glTF/specification/2.0/schema/gltf.schema.json -l 2 -p schema/ -i "['gltfid.schema.json', 'gltfchildofrootproperty.schema.json', 'gltfproperty.schema.json']" -a | clip
```

That will generate documentation for glTF.schema.json, as well as all referenced schemas,
all in a single set of markdown with inter-type linking.  By specifying the `-p` parameter,
you've indicated where the actual json schema files will live relative to the documentation
so that the type documentation can directly link to the type json file. By specifying the
`-a` parameter, it will aggressively attempt to auto-link all referenced type names with each other.

By specifying the `-i` property and that array of filenames, you are ensuring that there won't
be a Table of Contents entry for those types, nor will there be individual documentation sections
for those types (since they only exist to be referenced by other types to make type composition/authoring
simpler and consistent).

<a name="Limitations"></a>
## Limitations

This tool was developed to generate reference documentaiton for the [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) schema.  As such, it currently only supports JSON Schema 3 and 4, and doesn't support the entire JSON Schema spec.  However, wetzel is easy to hack on, just edit [lib/generateMarkdown.js](lib/generateMarkdown.js).
